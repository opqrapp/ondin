# Feature Flags Schema Reference

This file contains information about where to find the Ecto schema definitions for the feature flagging system in Ondin.

## Schema Files

All database schema definitions for the feature flagging system are located in the `lib/ondin/feature_flags/` directory. The following schema modules define the database structure:

- `lib/ondin/feature_flags/project.ex` - Defines the "projects" table schema
- `lib/ondin/feature_flags/feature.ex` - Defines the "features" table schema
- `lib/ondin/feature_flags/rule.ex` - Defines the "rules" table schema
- `lib/ondin/feature_flags/condition.ex` - Defines the "conditions" table schema

## Schema Relationships

The relationships between these schemas are:

- `Project` has many `Features`
- `Feature` belongs to a `Project` and has many `Rules`
- `Rule` belongs to a `Feature` and has many `Conditions`
- `Condition` belongs to a `Rule`

Each schema file contains the Ecto schema definition, changesets with validations, and any helper functions related to the model.
