# NIX

Nix helps make sure all developers work in the same environment by creating a 
standard setup for building the project.

We've created several nix flakes that let developers with Nix installed on their 
computers set up their development environment quickly and easily.

* `nix/backend/flake.nix` - contains everything needed for backend development.
* `nix/frontend/flake.nix` - contains everything needed for frontend development.
